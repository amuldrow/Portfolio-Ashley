This portfolio was created as a resource to provide to future employers to showcase my skills in the various coding languages I have been able to obtain while in my coding bootcamp. This portfolio was created using advanced Css and Html. Included in this portfolio is an about me section that gives a short background about me and a projects section that has links to all of the projects I have completed so far and lastly a contact me section that lists a few ways to get in contact with me.
